# Chingoal Demo #

Demonstration single page web application Chingoal.

### Why just a single page ###

The original Chingoal application is shut down accidentally, so I made this demo page to make a quick illustration of what Chingoal does.

### A quick overview ###
This demo app is built with angular js, which gives examples of different learning modules in Chingoal. 
* The first one is writing, so try to mock the Chinese word and save them to see how you write.
* The second one is speaking, repeat what you heard and speak a lot.
* The third one is reading, read the word and translate according to the image.
